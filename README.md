## Introduction

The AI Component Generator is designed to simplify UI development by allowing users to describe the desired UI component in natural language. The backend processes the request, generates the appropriate component code, and sends it to the frontend for display. This tool aims to streamline the development process and make UI design more accessible.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Users can describe the UI component they need.
- **Dynamic Component Generation**: The AI processes the input and generates the requested component.
- **Styled Components**: Generated components come with default styling which can be customized.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the components look good on all devices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Python (for AI model)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-component-generator.git
   cd ai-component-generator
   ```
2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   ```sh
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```
4. **Setup Environment Variables**

   ```sh
   PORT=5000
   AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
5. **Start the Server**

   ```sh
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
6. **Start the Client**

  In a new terminal window:

   ```sh
  cd client
  npm start
  ```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.


## Usage

1. #### Open the Application

  Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

2. #### Enter a Component Request

  Use the input field to describe the component you need. For example: "Create a blue button with the text 'Submit'."

3. #### Generate and View the Component

  The AI will process your request and display the generated component on the page. You can interact with it and see the styling applied.

### Technologies
 Frontend: React, CSS-in-JS (styled-components or emotion)
 Backend: Node.js, Express.js
 AI: OpenAI API (or any preferred AI model for natural language processing)
